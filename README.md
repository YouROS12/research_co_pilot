# CRAS (Comprehensive Research Acceleration System) - Complete Development Specification

## Project Overview

Build an end-to-end autonomous research acceleration platform that ingests scientific papers, extracts novel research gaps using long-context LLMs, validates novelty through FutureHouse's Owl agent, generates executable project scaffolds, runs experiments, and drafts publication-ready papers with figures and citations.

---

## Core Philosophy & Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Automate the research lifecycle from literature discovery to paper submission, keeping humans in critical decision points while accelerating everything else.

**Key Principles**:
- Every AI-generated claim must include explicit provenance (paper ID, chunk ID, page number, exact quote)
- Only high-quality sources (Q1/Q2 journals with impact factor ≤4) are indexed
- Novelty is guaranteed through FutureHouse Owl integration before any idea enters the development phase
- The system is iterative: failed experiments feed back into the LLM for improvement
- All costs are tracked and capped to prevent runaway API spending

   - Fallback: OCR layer for scanned/low-quality PDFs
   - Extract and store metadata: DOI, title, authors, journal name, publication year, impact factor, quartile ranking

3. Storage architecture:
   - Relational database schema with tables for: papers, authors, chunks, references, journals
   - Object storage for: original PDFs, parsed text files, extracted figures
   - Implement deduplication logic (check DOI before ingesting)

4. Quality filtering pipeline:
   - Reject papers from journals outside Q1/Q2 quartiles
   - Reject papers from journals with impact factor > 4
   - Flag predatory journals using known lists
   - Store rejection reason for audit trail

**Success Criteria**:

### Phase B: Chunking, Embedding & Retrieval (Weeks 4-6)

**Deliverables**:
1. Intelligent chunking system:
   - Chunk by logical sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)
   - For long sections, use sliding window with overlap (2000 tokens per chunk, 300 token overlap)
   - Preserve section boundaries and hierarchies
   - Tag chunks with metadata: chunk_type, paper_id, section_name, page_numbers

2. Embedding generation:
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk using a state-of-the-art embedding model
   - Store embeddings in vector database with metadata
   - Implement batch processing for efficiency

3. Vector database setup:
   - Choose and configure vector DB (Milvus, Weaviate, or Pinecone)
   - Create collections with appropriate indexing for fast retrieval
   - Implement semantic search API: given a query, return top-k relevant chunks with scores

4. Retrieval system (for RAG):
   - Hybrid search: combine vector similarity + keyword matching + recency weighting
   - Return results with full provenance: paper_id, chunk_id, section, page, similarity_score
   - Implement filtering by date range, journal, author, citation count

**Success Criteria**:
- All 100 test papers chunked and embedded
- Vector search returns relevant chunks for test queries
- Average query latency < 500ms

   - Use small/medium LLM (GPT-5 or Gemini Pro 2.5 in cost-efficient mode)
   - For each paper, generate: 3-5 sentence summary, key findings, explicit limitations, methodology overview
   - Output structured JSON with provenance references
   - Store summaries in database for reuse

2. Cluster-based gap extraction:
   - Group papers by topic/field using embeddings + clustering algorithms
   - For each cluster (e.g., 20-50 papers), pass summaries + selected full chunks to long-context LLM (1M+ token window)
   - Prompt engineering:
     - System role: "You are a research discovery engine specializing in identifying unexplored research opportunities"
     - Input: paper summaries, existing ideas from Idea Bank (to avoid duplication), domain context
     - Output requirement: 3-7 novel research gaps per cluster
     - Each gap must include:
       - Title (concise, 6-10 words)
       - Description (2-4 sentences explaining the gap)
       - Supporting evidence (direct quotes from papers with paper_id + chunk_id + page)
       - Rationale for novelty
       - Estimated difficulty (low/medium/high)
       - Suggested methodologies (e.g., "transformer architecture", "meta-analysis", "RCT")
       - Expected resources (datasets, compute, time estimate)
       - Potential impact score (1-10)

3. Hierarchical RAG implementation:
   - Level 1: Retrieve relevant paper summaries
   - Level 2: For promising gaps, retrieve full chunks from source papers
   - Level 3: Provide deep context to LLM for final gap formulation
   - Ensure token budget management to avoid exceeding context windows

4. Provenance tracking system:
   - Every gap must trace back to specific paper sections
   - Store provenance chain: gap → supporting_evidence → chunk → paper → section → page
   - Enable UI to display "View Evidence" links that highlight exact source text

**Success Criteria**:

     - Novelty classification: duplicate / partially explored / novel
     - Evidence: list of similar existing works with DOIs, titles, similarity scores
     - Explanation: why it's duplicate/partial/novel

2. Novelty scoring pipeline:
   - Combine Owl's verdict with internal vector similarity checks
   - Generate composite novelty score (0-100):
     - 0-30: Duplicate (reject or flag for review)
     - 31-70: Partially explored (may be worth pursuing with new angle)
     - 71-100: Novel (prioritize)
   - Store novelty metadata with each idea

3. Deduplication within Idea Bank:
   - Before adding a new gap to Idea Bank, check against existing ideas
   - Use Owl + internal embeddings to detect near-duplicates
   - If duplicate found, merge or link ideas

4. Audit trail:
   - Log every Owl API call with query, response, timestamp
   - Enable manual review of Owl verdicts
   - Allow human override (e.g., domain expert believes Owl missed something)

**Success Criteria**:

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### Per-Paper Summary Prompt
```
System: You are a scientific paper summarizer. Be concise and precise.

Task: Summarize this paper in 3-5 bullet points covering:
- Research context and motivation
- Main methodology
- Key results/findings
- Explicit limitations mentioned by authors

For each point, include exact quotes with page numbers for verification.

Input: [paper_title, abstract, key_chunks]

Output format: JSON
{
  "summary": "...",
  "methodology": "...",
  "findings": ["...", "..."],
  "limitations": [
    {"text": "...", "quote": "...", "page": N}
  ]
}
```

### Gap Extraction Prompt
```
System: You are a research discovery engine. Your goal is to identify novel, actionable research gaps from a collection of papers.

Context: You will receive summaries of {N} papers in the field of {domain}. You also have access to {M} existing ideas already in the Idea Bank.

Task: Identify 3-7 novel research gaps that:
1. Are not already explored in the provided papers
2. Are not duplicates of existing ideas in the Idea Bank
3. Are feasible within 6-12 months with available resources
4. Have potential for high impact (citations, practical applications)

For each gap, provide:
- title: 6-10 words, specific and actionable
- description: 2-4 sentences explaining what is missing and why it matters
- supporting_evidence: Array of {paper_id, chunk_id, quote, page_number} showing evidence for the gap
- rationale_for_novelty: Why this hasn't been done yet
- difficulty: low/medium/high
- suggested_methods: 1-3 specific approaches (e.g., "transformer with attention pooling", "meta-analysis of RCTs")
- required_resources: {data_sources: [...], compute: "...", estimated_time: "..."}
- potential_impact: 1-10 score with justification

CRITICAL: Never invent quotes or papers. Only reference provided papers. If uncertain, mark as "speculative" and explain why.

Input: [paper_summaries, existing_ideas, domain_context]

Output format: JSON array of gap objects
```

### Novelty Check Prompt (for Owl query construction)

- Specific enough to avoid false matches
- General enough to catch similar work
- Focused on the novel contribution, not just the domain

Example:
Idea: "Multi-modal sentiment analysis combining text and facial expressions for video reviews"
Query: "Has anyone combined text sentiment analysis with facial expression recognition for analyzing video product reviews or testimonials?"

Your turn:
Idea: {idea_title}
Description: {idea_description}
Query: 
```

Generate:
1. train.py - Training script with hyperparameters, logging, checkpointing
2. model.py - Model architecture implementation
3. data_loader.py - Dataset class and preprocessing
4. evaluate.py - Evaluation metrics and validation loop
5. requirements.txt - All dependencies with versions
6. README.md - Setup instructions, usage examples, expected results
7. config.yaml - Configurable hyperparameters

## Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Database CRUD operations
- Chunking logic (boundary cases: very short/long sections)
- Embedding generation (mock API responses)
- Ranking algorithm (test with synthetic data)
- Provenance linking

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end ingestion: submit paper → parse → chunk → embed → store
- Gap extraction pipeline: papers → summaries → gaps → provenance
- Novelty check: idea → Owl query → verdict → storage
- Scaffold generation: idea → code → Git repo
- Experiment run: scaffold → execute → capture results

### LLM Output Validation
- Check for hallucinations: verify all cited papers exist in database
- Provenance completeness: every claim has paper_id + chunk_id + page
- Code functionality: generated code passes basic syntax checks and runs
- Draft coherence: paper sections follow logical flow, no contradictions

### Performance Tests
- Load test API endpoints (100 concurrent users)
- Vector search latency under high query volume
- LLM response time monitoring
- Database query optimization (check for N+1 queries)

### Security Tests
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attacks on user inputs
- Authentication bypass attempts
- API rate limit enforcement

### User Acceptance Testing
- Recruit 5-10 researchers to test full workflow
- Gather feedback on UI, idea quality, scaffold usefulness
- Measure: time to complete full cycle, satisfaction scores, number of bugs found

---

## Cost Management & Optimization

### Cost Tracking
- Log every API call with: timestamp, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, cost
- Aggregate by: day, week, month, user, project
- Dashboard showing: total spend, spend by service (GPT-5, Gemini, Owl), projected monthly cost

### Budget Controls
- Set per-user monthly limits (configurable)
- Set system-wide daily/monthly caps
- Alert admin at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget
- Auto-pause expensive operations (gap extraction, paper drafting) if over budget
- Require manual approval for operations estimated > $X

### Optimization Strategies
- Cache LLM responses (especially summaries, novelty checks) with 30-day TTL
- Use smaller models for simple tasks (summarization → Gemini, not GPT-5)
- Batch processing: group multiple papers for cluster analysis instead of one-by-one
- Implement prompt compression techniques to reduce input tokens
- Use streaming for long outputs to improve perceived latency
- Rate limit non-critical operations during peak cost periods
- Implement token counting before API calls to estimate costs upfront

### Cost Estimation Formula
```
Daily Cost Estimate = 
  (papers_ingested × avg_chunks_per_paper × embedding_cost_per_chunk) +
  (summaries_generated × avg_tokens_per_summary × llm_cost_per_token) +
  (gaps_extracted × avg_tokens_per_gap_extraction × llm_cost_per_token) +
  (novelty_checks × owl_cost_per_check) +
  (scaffolds_generated × avg_tokens_per_scaffold × llm_cost_per_token) +
  (experiments_run × compute_cost_per_hour × avg_hours_per_experiment) +
  (drafts_generated × avg_tokens_per_draft × llm_cost_per_token)
```

Build a cost estimator tool that admins can use to project costs based on expected usage patterns.

## Security & Compliance Requirements

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest (database, object storage)
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant scenarios
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR compliance: user data deletion, data export, consent management

### Legal & Ethical Guardrails

**Copyright & Licensing**:
- Store license metadata for every paper (Open Access, CC-BY, etc.)
- Reject ingestion of papers without clear access rights
- Use Unpaywall API to verify Open Access status
- Watermark generated drafts with "AI-assisted, requires human review"
- Never reproduce large verbatim sections from source papers in drafts

**Audit Trail**:
- Log every LLM interaction: prompt, response, timestamp, model, user
- Store decision history: why was an idea rejected/approved?
- Enable full traceability: from ingested paper → gap → scaffold → experiment → draft
- Retain logs for minimum 2 years for legal compliance

**User Responsibilities**:
- Terms of Service requiring users to:
  - Verify novelty before claiming invention
  - Disclose AI assistance in publications
  - Follow ethical guidelines for experiments (IRB approval if needed)
  - Not use system for harmful research (weapons, bioterrorism, etc.)
- Flag system: allow users to report problematic content
- Manual review queue for flagged items

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions:
  - **Researcher**: ingest papers, explore ideas, run experiments, draft papers
  - **Reviewer**: review ideas, approve scaffolds, cannot modify system config
  - **Admin**: full access, user management, cost controls, system config
- API key scoping: keys can be limited to specific endpoints or rate limits
- Audit logs for privileged actions (config changes, user role changes)

---

## Observability & Monitoring Requirements

### Application Metrics (Expose via Prometheus)
- `cras_papers_ingested_total` - Counter of papers successfully ingested
- `cras_papers_failed_total` - Counter of failed ingestion attempts
- `cras_chunks_created_total` - Counter of chunks generated
- `cras_ideas_generated_total` - Counter of ideas added to Idea Bank
- `cras_experiments_running` - Gauge of currently running experiments
- `cras_api_requests_total` - Counter by endpoint and status code
- `cras_api_latency_seconds` - Histogram of request latencies
- `cras_llm_tokens_consumed_total` - Counter by model (GPT-5, Gemini)
- `cras_llm_cost_usd_total` - Counter of cumulative LLM costs
- `cras_owl_queries_total` - Counter of Owl API calls
- `cras_vector_search_latency_seconds` - Histogram of vector search times

### Business Metrics Dashboard
- Papers ingested per day/week/month (line chart)
- Ideas generated per day (bar chart)
- Novelty score distribution (histogram)
- Experiments success/failure rate (pie chart)
- Average time from idea to draft (funnel chart)
- Cost breakdown by service (stacked area chart)
- User activity: active users, papers per user, ideas per user

### Alerting Rules
- **Critical**: API error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- **Critical**: Database connection failures
- **Critical**: Vector DB unavailable
- **Warning**: Daily cost exceeds 120% of average
- **Warning**: LLM API latency > 30s (indicates potential issues)
- **Warning**: Disk usage > 80%
- **Info**: New user registration
- **Info**: Experiment completed

### Logging Strategy
- Structured JSON logs with fields: timestamp, level, service, request_id, user_id, message, metadata
- Correlation IDs: track a single request across all microservices
- Log levels: DEBUG (dev only), INFO (normal operations), WARN (recoverable errors), ERROR (failures), CRITICAL (system-wide issues)
- Centralized logging: aggregate logs from all services (ELK stack, CloudWatch, or similar)
- Log retention: 30 days for DEBUG/INFO, 90 days for WARN/ERROR, indefinite for CRITICAL
- Sensitive data: never log passwords, API keys, or PII

### Development Workflow
1. **Local Setup**:
   - Clone repo
   - Run `scripts/setup_dev.sh` to install dependencies
   - Start services with `docker-compose up` (Postgres, Vector DB, GROBID)
   - Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
   - Seed test data: `python scripts/seed_data.py`
   - Start API: `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
   - Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

2. **Feature Development**:
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/idea-ranking`
   - Write unit tests first (TDD)
   - Implement feature
   - Run tests locally: `pytest tests/`
   - Run linting: `black . && flake8`
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Push and create PR

3. **Code Review**:
   - PR must pass CI checks (tests, linting, build)
   - Requires 1 approval from another developer
   - Security scan must pass (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
   - Test coverage must not decrease

4. **Deployment**:
   - Merge to `main` triggers CD pipeline
   - Automated deployment to staging environment
   - Run integration tests in staging
   - Manual approval for production deployment
   - Rollout with blue-green deployment (zero downtime)
   - Monitor for 1 hour post-deployment

## Integration Details

### FutureHouse Owl Integration Specification

**API Client Implementation Requirements**:

```python
# Pseudo-code for Owl client structure

class OwlClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, base_url: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.session = create_http_session()
    
    def check_novelty(self, idea: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Send idea to Owl for novelty assessment
        
        Args:
            idea: {
                "title": str,
                "description": str,
                "keywords": List[str],
                "field": str
            }
        
        Returns:
            {
                "novelty_class": "duplicate" | "partial" | "novel",
                "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
                "similar_works": [
                    {
                        "doi": str,
                        "title": str,
                        "similarity_score": 0.0-1.0,
                        "summary": str
                    }
                ],
                "explanation": str,
                "evidence": [...]
            }
        """
        # Convert idea to natural language query
        query = self._construct_query(idea)
        
        # Call Owl API
        response = self._api_call("has_anyone", {
            "query": query,
            "filters": {
                "fields": [idea["field"]],
                "min_year": 2015  # Only check recent work
            }
        })
        
        # Parse response
        return self._parse_owl_response(response)
    
    def _construct_query(self, idea: dict) -> str:
        """Convert idea into natural language 'Has anyone' query"""
        # Use GPT-5/Gemini to construct optimal query
        # Return query string
        pass
    
    def _api_call(self, endpoint: str, payload: dict) -> dict:
        """Make authenticated API call to Owl"""
        # Handle retries, rate limiting, errors
        pass
    
    def _parse_owl_response(self, response: dict) -> dict:
        """Extract structured novelty assessment"""
        # Parse Owl's response format
        pass
```

**Owl API Call Lifecycle**:
1. User triggers novelty check for an idea (manually or automatically after gap generation)
2. System constructs query using LLM prompt (see prompt template above)
3. Call Owl API with query + field filters + date range
4. Owl returns similar works with explanations
5. System parses response, assigns novelty score (0-100)
6. Store Owl verdict + similar works + explanation in database
7. Update idea's novelty score and status
8. Notify user of results

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache Owl responses by idea_id for 30 days
- If idea description changes significantly (>50% text difference), invalidate cache
- Implement cache warming: pre-check novelty for newly generated gaps overnight

**Error Handling**:
- If Owl API is down: fallback to internal vector similarity check, mark idea as "novelty_pending"
- If query fails: retry 3 times with exponential backoff
- If persistent failure: alert admin, queue for manual review
- Track Owl API uptime and reliability metrics

### GPT-5 Integration Specification

**API Client Structure**:
```python
class GPT5Client:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        self.model = "gpt-5"  # Use actual model name when available
    
    def generate_gaps(self, context: dict, max_tokens: int = 4000) -> List[dict]:
        """
        Extract research gaps from paper summaries

                "existing_ideas": List[str],  # From Idea Bank
                "domain": str,
                "cluster_theme": str
            }
        
        Returns: List of gap objects
        """
        prompt = self._build_gap_extraction_prompt(context)
        
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            temperature=0.3,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            response_format={"type": "json_object"}
        )
        
        return self._parse_gaps(response)
    
    def generate_code_scaffold(self, idea: dict) -> dict:
        """Generate project scaffold code"""
        # Similar structure for code generation
        pass
    
    def draft_paper_section(self, section: str, context: dict) -> str:
        """Draft a paper section"""
        # Similar structure for paper writing
        pass
```

**Token Management**:
- Implement pre-flight token counting to estimate costs
- Set per-request token limits to prevent runaway costs
- Use truncation strategies for very long contexts (prioritize recent papers, higher-impact journals)
- Monitor token usage per endpoint and user

### Gemini Pro 2.5 Integration Specification

**Use Cases**:
- Per-paper summarization (cheaper than GPT-5 for bulk operations)
- Quick Q&A for user queries about papers
- Figure/table extraction from PDFs (multimodal capability)
- Backup when GPT-5 is unavailable

**API Client Structure**: Similar to GPT-5 client, but with Gemini-specific parameters

**Model Selection Logic**:
```python
def select_model_for_task(task_type: str, context_size: int, budget_available: float) -> str:
    """
    Choose between GPT-5 and Gemini based on task requirements
    
    Rules:
    - Long-context (>100k tokens): GPT-5 (better quality)
    - Summarization: Gemini (cost-effective)
    - Code generation: GPT-5 (better at complex code)
    - Paper drafting: GPT-5 (higher quality writing)
    - Simple Q&A: Gemini
    - Multimodal (image/PDF): Gemini
    - Budget depleted: Use only Gemini or queue for later
    """
    if budget_available < LOW_BUDGET_THRESHOLD:
        return "gemini-pro-2.5"
    
    if task_type == "gap_extraction" and context_size > 100000:
        return "gpt-5"
    elif task_type in ["summarization", "qa"]:
        return "gemini-pro-2.5"
    elif task_type in ["code_generation", "paper_writing"]:
        return "gpt-5"
    else:
        return "gemini-pro-2.5"  # Default to cheaper option
```

- Tune index parameters based on recall vs. latency trade-off
- Implement index warming after deployment (pre-load hot data)
- Monitor index rebuild times and schedule during low-traffic periods

### API Performance
- Implement response caching (Redis) for frequently accessed resources
- Use pagination for list endpoints (max 100 items per page)
- Implement request coalescing for duplicate simultaneous requests
- Use async/await throughout for I/O-bound operations
- Implement background task processing for long-running operations

### LLM Call Optimization
- Batch similar requests when possible (e.g., summarize 10 papers in one call)
- Implement request deduplication (same prompt within 1 hour → return cached result)
- Use prompt compression techniques to reduce input tokens
- Stream responses for long outputs to improve perceived latency
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for LLM API failures

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: LLM API providers have outages or rate limits
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement multi-provider fallback (GPT-5 → Gemini)
- Queue requests and retry with exponential backoff
- Monitor provider status pages and adjust routing

**Risk**: Vector database performance degrades at scale
**Mitigation**:
- Implement sharding strategy for large collections
- Regular index optimization and rebuilding
- Monitor query latency and scale horizontally if needed

**Risk**: Generated code contains bugs or security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**:
- Run automated linting and security scans on generated code
- Sandbox experiment execution (Docker containers with resource limits)
- Provide disclaimers and require human review

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Generated ideas are not actually novel (Owl misses duplicates)
**Mitigation**:
- Human expert review for high-value ideas before major investment
- Multiple novelty checks (Owl + internal + manual review)
- Clear disclaimers about AI limitations

**Risk**: Copyright violations in paper drafts
**Mitigation**:
- Never reproduce long verbatim quotes from source papers
- Watermark all drafts with "AI-assisted, requires review"
- Store provenance for all content
- Implement plagiarism checker before export

**Risk**: Costs spiral out of control
**Mitigation**:
- Hard budget caps with automatic shutdown
- Real-time cost monitoring and alerts
- Per-user usage quotas
- Admin approval for expensive operations

### Legal/Ethical Risks

**Risk**: System used for harmful research (weapons, bioterrorism)
**Mitigation**:
- Terms of Service prohibiting harmful use
- Manual review queue for flagged content
- Content filtering for dangerous keywords/topics
- User verification and background checks for sensitive domains

**Risk**: User claims AI-generated work without disclosure
**Mitigation**:
- Terms of Service requiring disclosure
- Watermarks on all generated content
- Audit trail of all system usage
- Educational resources on ethical AI use

## Developer Notes & Recommendations

### Technology Selection Freedom
While GPT-5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and FutureHouse Owl APIs are specified, you have freedom to choose:
- **Backend framework**: FastAPI (recommended), Django, Flask, or Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended), MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Vector DB**: Milvus, Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant, or Chroma
- **Frontend**: React (recommended), Vue, Angular, or Svelte
- **Containerization**: Docker (required for experiments)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, ECS, or Docker Swarm
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, Azure, or self-hosted
- **Message Queue**: Celery+Redis, RabbitMQ, or Kafka
- **Caching**: Redis or Memcached

### Development Priorities
1. **Start with ingestion**: Get papers flowing into the system first
2. **Build RAG early**: Retrieval is foundation for everything
3. **Mock LLMs initially**: Use simple heuristics/templates to test workflows before connecting real APIs
4. **Iterate on prompts**: Prompt engineering is 50% of system quality
5. **Test with real papers**: Use diverse papers to catch edge cases
6. **Get user feedback early**: Beta test after each phase

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't underestimate prompt engineering time**: Budget 30% of development time
- **Don't skip provenance tracking**: It's critical for trust and debugging
- **Don't ignore costs early**: Implement tracking from day 1
- **Don't optimize prematurely**: Get it working, then make it fast
- **Don't skip error handling**: LLM APIs fail, handle gracefully
- **Don't hardcode model names**: Abstract LLM calls for easy switching

### Questions to Resolve During Development
1. What embedding model will we use? (Dimension affects vector DB config)
2. What is the exact Owl API contract? (Get API docs early)
3. What journals/sources should we prioritize initially?
4. What programming languages should scaffolds support? (Python first? Others?)
5. What citation format(s) do we need? (BibTeX, RIS, etc.)
6. What experiment compute limits? (Max GPU hours, memory, etc.)
7. Who are the initial beta users? (Target domain/field)
